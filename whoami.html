			<p>
				I graduated in July 2017 with a First Class in my BSc in Physics from the University of São Paulo. 
				<br><br>
				After graduating I immediately started a master degree in theoretical physics and after 5 months I also started working at Ernst & Young to try something out of the academy that would still use my analytical and problem solving skills. 
				<br><br>
				After 4 months working at EY I quit to dedicate myself fully to the master degree. However, after I finished the degree’s coursework (1 year) I concluded that theoretical physics research wasn’t the path for me, so I started studying web development/data science and relocated to London to find my first professional role in software development/data science. 
				<br><br>
				I’m currently looking for a challenging analytical role within technology where I can utilise both my analytical skill set and my tech skills.
